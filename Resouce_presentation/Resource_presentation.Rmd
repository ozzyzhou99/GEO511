## Introduction to `spatstat`

`spatstat` is an R package for spatial point pattern analysis. It provides tools for analyzing, visualizing, and modeling spatial point patterns, which makes it useful in a variety of applications in fields such as ecology, epidemiology, and geography.

Researchers can use `spatstat` to understand the spatial distribution of points, assess clustering or regularity, and simulate point processes.

## Features Overview

- **Visualization**: Plot points and various plots to understand the spatial structure of your data.
- **Spatial Analysis**: Use functions such as K-function or G-function to assess clustering or regularity.
- **Density Estimation**: Calculate the density of points over a spatial region.
- **Simulation**: Simulate random point patterns based on different spatial processes (e.g., Poisson process).

Below, I will walk through example inputs and introduce some key functions.

## Demonstration of Spatstat Functionalities

In this case, I will briefly introduce the main features of the `spatstat` package, including:

- Data preparation and point visualization.
- K-function analysis for evaluating spatial clustering.
- Density estimation for identifying spatial hotspots.
- Random point pattern simulation.
- Multi-type point pattern analysis.

## Summary

The `spatstat` package can help researchers gain a deeper understanding of the distribution characteristics and underlying laws of spatial point data, and is an essential tool for spatial point pattern analysis.
